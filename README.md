This is a collection of C and C++ headers that you can drag into your repository. I would highly recommend that you don't include this as a submodule in the case of function changes breaking compatibility.

# Directory tree
- `/include/` - headers that can be used in either C or C++ code
- `/include/c/` - C-only headers
- `/include/cpp/` - C++-only headers
